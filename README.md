### Turning Any Job Description into an AI-Driven Architecture & Portfolio Project

This repository provides a **repeatable framework** for transforming any technical job description into:

- An AI + MCP project concept
- A structured architecture case study
- A senior-level technical portfolio artifact

## Quick Start

1. Copy a job description.
2. Use the prompt in `/prompts/generate_mcp_project.txt` with ChatGPT.
3. Save the generated architecture as a new project in `/examples`.
4. Push to GitHub and iterate.
