# README.md  
## MCP AI Project Generator (Career Portfolio MVP)

### Overview  
This repository demonstrates a **repeatable framework** for transforming a job description into a **real MCP-based AI engineering project**.

The goal is to show that the engineer:

- Understands the **technical domain**
- Identifies **real operational problems**
- Designs **AI-driven automation**
- Thinks like a **systems architect and project manager**
- Can build a **practical MVP using MCP + Cursor**

---

# Core Concept

**Job description → Domain analysis → Problem discovery → MCP AI project → MVP implementation**

Pipeline:

1. Parse role requirements  
2. Extract domain knowledge areas  
3. Identify operational pain points  
4. Design MCP-based AI solution  
5. Build MVP in Cursor  
6. Demonstrate measurable value  

---

# MVP Goal

Build a **minimal working MCP AI Copilot** that can:

- Collect **basic telemetry or logs**
- Provide **one automated RCA scenario**
- Generate a **customer-ready incident summary**

---

# Success Criteria
